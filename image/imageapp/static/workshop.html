Description:

Here are some typical features of workshops (especially of the learning / collaborative kind):

Feature	Description
Objective	Clear goal(s): what outcome is expected (new skill learnt, plan made, problem solved).

Facilitation	Usually one or more facilitators who guide the workshop, manage time, encourage participation, keep the group on track.

Participation	Interactive: participants do more than listen â€” they discuss, practice, collaborate.

Hands-on / practical work	Often involves doing tasks, exercises, making something or prototyping or problem solving. 

Time-bounded	Fixed duration; can be a few hours to several days, but not open-ended courses. 

Group size	Relatively small enough for everyone to participate meaningfully; the size depends on the format. 

Resources and logistics	Needs suitable venue, tools/materials, possibly equipment, supplies; proper planning is required.
